## Motivation & History

Since its inception in 2014, the Meilenwölfe fanclub has quickly risen the ranks in the local football community and has 
become one of the largest VfL Wolfsburg fanclubs. To date, the club has travelled an impressive 50.000 miles to away matches all over Europe.
With more than 180 members, managing all the moving parts manually soon became increasingly difficult.

The idea of the Meilenshop ("Miles shop") was born out of these day-to-day problems both the organizers and, to a certain extent, the 
club members faced. Instead of redirecting interested people to email or WhatsApp channels and manually entering them into an excel file, 
why not provide a central web interface for everyone? 

The development for the website was started in early 2017, originally as a team project for a university course at the 
Otto-von-Guericke University in Magdeburg.
Following the official launch in the summer of 2018, the Meilenshop has since become the standard way for people to find 
out about upcoming Meilenwölfe tours, events and even merchandise.
